## **Overview**

This project uses **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and other Python libraries to implement a pipeline for recognizing license plates in images. The pipeline includes:

1. Detecting the license plate in an image.
2. Segmenting the characters on the plate.
3. Classifying the characters using a deep learning model.

The system was trained on a custom dataset and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## **Key Features**
- **License Plate Detection**: Uses contour detection and image preprocessing to locate plates in vehicle images.
- **Character Segmentation**: Efficiently segments individual characters from the detected license plate.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras to classify characters.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From image input to license plate number extraction.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualizes detected license plates, segmented characters, and model predictions.
